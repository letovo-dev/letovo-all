It's commonly used for API requests where users are authenticated before accessing resources.\n\n4. **Response Configuration**:\n   - **Status Code**: `200` indicates a successful request, meaning the server has processed the GET request and sent back relevant data without errors.\n   - **Headers**:\n     - `Server`: Describes which web server software was used to serve this HTTP response (e.g., Apache, NGINX).\n     - `Date`: The date and time when the response was generated by the server.\n     - `Content-Type`: Specifies the type of content being sent in the body of the response (e.g., text/plain, application/json).\n     - `Content-Length`: The size of the response's body.\n     - `Connection`: Information about whether the connection should stay open for further communications or be closed.\n\nIn essence, this configuration sets up an endpoint to handle GET requests aiming to retrieve QR code details associated with posts. Users must authenticate by providing a \"Bearer\" token in their request headers to access this service. The server confirms the request's success with a `200` status code and includes various header fields for information about how the response was generated, its content type, size, etc."
